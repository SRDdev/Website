          I am an Undergraduate student majoring in Electronics & Telecommunications at VIIT Pune. I have a keen interest in the field of <b>Deep Learning</b>, with a specific focus on the intersection of Language and Vision modalities. I enjoy exploring and implementing research ideas, and have a passion for communicating my work through articles and teaching others through courses and talks.
          <br/><br/>
          I like to write highly readable and self-contained code, with Python being my primary programming language. I am an <b>intermediate learner in TensorFlow</b> and a beginner in PyTorch. 
          <br/><br/>
          I am currently working on <b>building Open Source models on HuggingFace</b> and learning about Generative Adversarial Nets. Off the work, I enjoy writing technical articles and giving talks about Machine Learning. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to help!
